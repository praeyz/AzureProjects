# Create and Execute a Query Leveraging Azure SQL Serverless

## Introduction

In this hands-on lab, I have been asked to solve some basic SQL challenges. Bethany's is currently a heavy Azure Synapse Analytics user, and so I have been asked to show proficiency in T-SQL queries using Azure Synapse Analytics Serverless compute.

## Lab Objectives

1. **Prepare the Environment**: Set up the necessary Azure resources, including provisioning Azure Synapse Analytics workspace and the required data sources.
2. **Add Sample Datasets**: Load sample datasets for practicing SQL queries.
3. **Investigate the US Population by Zip Code Table**: Analyze and explore the data using T-SQL queries.
4. **Run Sample Scripts**: Execute sample scripts to demonstrate your ability to work with Azure SQL Serverless.

## Steps and Process

### Provision Azure Synapse Analytics Workspace

- Set up an Azure Synapse Analytics workspace to manage and orchestrate data analytics activities.

### Load Sample Datasets

- Define and upload the sample datasets required for the lab.
- Ensure data is correctly formatted and accessible for querying.

### Investigate the US Population by Zip Code Table

- Use T-SQL queries to analyze and explore the US population data.
- Derive insights and perform data manipulation as needed.

### Execute Sample Scripts

- Run the provided sample scripts to showcase your proficiency in using Azure SQL Serverless.
- Modify and create new scripts as necessary to solve the given SQL challenges.

## Conclusion

This lab provided a practical experience in using Azure Synapse Analytics Serverless compute for T-SQL queries. I gained hands-on experience in setting up the environment, loading datasets, analyzing data, and executing SQL scripts. This lab demonstrates my ability to efficiently work with Azure SQL Serverless and solve real-world SQL challenges.
