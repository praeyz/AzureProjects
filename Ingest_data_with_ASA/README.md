# Ingest Data Using an Azure Synapse Pipeline

## Overview

In this hands-on lab, I created an SQL DB and Synapse Workspace. In the Synapse Workspace, I created a multi-step pipeline that will copy data from my SQL DB and move it to a data lake. You will also learn how to create activity dependencies.

## Learning Objectives

- Create the Resources Needed for the Lab
- Create the Linked Service and Datasets
- Create the Data Pipeline
- Create a Failure Alert and Run the Pipeline


## Steps

### 1. Create the Resources Needed for the Lab
- Set up an Azure SQL Database.
- Create an Azure Synapse Workspace.

### 2. Create the Linked Service and Datasets
- Define the connections to your data sources and sinks.

### 3. Create the Data Pipeline
- Set up a multi-step pipeline to move data from your SQL DB to a data lake.

### 4. Create a Failure Alert and Run the Pipeline
- Configure alerts for pipeline failures and execute the pipeline to test its functionality.

## Conclusion

I gained hands-on experience in creating and managing data pipelines using Azure Synapse, as well as monitoring and troubleshooting them.
